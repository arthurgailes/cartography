Description: Create and integrate maps in your R workflow. This
    package helps to design cartographic representations such as
    proportional symbols, choropleth, typology, flows or discontinuities
    maps. It also offers several features that improve the graphic
    presentation of maps, for instance, map palettes, layout elements
    (scale, north arrow, title...), labels or legends. See Giraud and
    Lambert (2017) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-57336-6_13>.
